Self-Evaluation as a Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on LLMs
2024-07-03T16:03:42Z
  When LLMs are deployed in sensitive, human-facing settings, it is crucial
that they do not output unsafe, biased, or privacy-violating outputs. For this
reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe
prompts such as "Tell me how to build a bomb." We find that, despite these
safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space
to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we
demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of
models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the
causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur
in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted,
overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings
underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the
importance of developing more robust alignment methods. Code and data will be
made available at https://github.com/Linlt-leon/Adversarial-Alignments.
